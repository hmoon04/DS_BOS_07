####Spark Installation:
If you'd like to follow along with the Spark notebook you can attempt to install Spark locally so that you can run the PySpark manipulations (these instructions are for a Mac).

1. Install Spark on your Mac by following the directions [here](http://genomegeek.blogspot.com/2014/11/how-to-install-apache-spark-on-mac-os-x.html)  
2. If necessary, make the adjustments to the launch jar file as seen [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31637752/building-apache-spark-using-sbt-invalid-or-corrupt-jarfile)  
3. Follow the instructions [here](http://ramhiser.com/2015/02/01/configuring-ipython-notebook-support-for-pyspark/) to get the notebook working with PySpark within IPython.  A copy of the [00-pyspark-setup.py](00-pyspark-setup.py) file that worked for me has been included on the repo.  
4. Try loading the notebook and see if it works for you.
